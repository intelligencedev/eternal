Plan to Improve Code Organization for Unit Testing with Go Testify
After reviewing the embedded Go code, here's a comprehensive plan to improve its organization for unit testing with Go Testify:
1. Refactor into Smaller Functions:
Many functions in the code are quite large and handle multiple responsibilities. This makes it difficult to isolate and test individual pieces of logic. Refactor these functions into smaller, more focused functions with clear inputs and outputs. This will make it easier to write unit tests that target specific behaviors.
2. Introduce Interfaces:
Use interfaces to decouple dependencies between different parts of the code. This allows you to mock dependencies in your unit tests, making it easier to test individual components in isolation. For example, instead of directly using the SQLiteDB struct, create an interface for database operations and have SQLiteDB implement that interface.
3. Organize Code by Package:
Currently, the code is spread across various files without a clear package structure. Organize the code into logical packages based on functionality. This will improve code clarity and maintainability, making it easier to navigate and test related code.
4. Use Dependency Injection:
Instead of directly creating dependencies within functions, pass them as arguments. This allows you to inject mocks or test doubles during unit testing.
5. Write Table-Driven Tests:
Go Testify provides excellent support for table-driven tests. This allows you to test the same functionality with different input sets in a concise and organized manner.
Specific Examples:
main.go:
The runFrontendServer function is very large. Break it down into smaller functions for handling routes, model loading, and other tasks.
Use interfaces for dependencies like the database and LLM clients.
db.go:
Create an interface for database operations and have SQLiteDB implement it.
Move database-related functions to a separate package.
llm/gguf.go:
The MakeCompletionWebSocket function has complex logic. Refactor it into smaller functions for building the command, processing output, and writing to the WebSocket.
vecstore/vecstore.go:
Create interfaces for vector storage and retrieval operations.
Move vector-related functions to a separate package.
Additional Tips:
Use descriptive names for functions and variables to improve code readability.
Add comments to explain complex logic and the purpose of functions.
Follow Go coding conventions and best practices.
Benefits:
Improved code modularity and maintainability.
Easier to write and understand unit tests.
Increased code coverage and confidence in code correctness.
More flexible and extensible code architecture.
By following these steps, you can significantly improve the organization of your Go code and make it much easier to write effective unit tests with Go Testify. This will lead to a more robust and reliable codebase.


Here's a list of other LLM prompt strategies that can be used to increase the chance of success:

1. Chain of Thought (CoT):
   - Description: Break down the problem into a series of steps or a sequence of thoughts that lead to the final answer.
   - Example: "Let's solve this problem step by step. First, ...; Second, ...; Third, ...; Therefore, ..."

2. Zero-Shot CoT:
   - Description: Provide a prompt that encourages the model to generate a chain of thought without explicit examples.
   - Example: "Analyze the given problem step by step, explaining your reasoning at each step before providing the final answer."

3. Self-Consistency:
   - Description: Generate multiple diverse chains of thought and then select the most consistent or frequent answer.
   - Example: "Generate three different approaches to solve the problem, and then compare and choose the most consistent solution."

4. Self-Critique:
   - Description: Encourage the model to critique its own generated answer and refine it if necessary.
   - Example: "After generating your initial answer, analyze its strengths and weaknesses, and propose improvements if needed."

5. Dialogue-Based:
   - Description: Engage in a back-and-forth dialogue with the model, asking clarifying questions and providing additional context.
   - Example: "Let's have a conversation to solve this problem. I'll provide more information as needed, and you can ask questions for clarification."

6. Decomposition:
   - Description: Break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
   - Example: "Decompose the main problem into smaller sub-problems, solve each sub-problem independently, and then combine the results."

7. Iterative Refinement:
   - Description: Generate an initial answer and then iteratively refine it based on feedback or additional requirements.
   - Example: "Provide your initial solution, and then I'll give you feedback. Use that feedback to refine and improve your answer."

8. Algorithmic Prompting:
   - Description: Provide a specific algorithm or problem-solving approach for the model to follow.
   - Example: "Use the following algorithm to solve the problem: 1) Initialize variables; 2) Perform the main computation; 3) Return the result."

9. Example-Based:
   - Description: Provide examples of similar problems and their solutions to guide the model.
   - Example: "Consider the following examples of similar problems and their solutions: [...]. Use these as a reference to solve the given problem."

10. Roleplay:
    - Description: Assign the model a specific role or persona to solve the problem from a particular perspective.
    - Example: "Take on the role of an experienced detective and analyze the given mystery using your deductive reasoning skills."

These are just a few examples of LLM prompt strategies that can be employed to enhance the model's performance and increase the chance of success. The choice of strategy depends on the specific task, problem domain, and the characteristics of the LLM being used.
